# Microverse RoR Capstone: liFEsTlye (World Unite)

> [liFEsTlye](https://www.behance.net/gallery/14554909/liFEsTlye-Mobile-version) is an articles pages where readers can get their daily dose of content, according to their categories. For this capstone, we had to create our own Article app, that I named **World Unite**, where we can get news from each and every continent of the world.
